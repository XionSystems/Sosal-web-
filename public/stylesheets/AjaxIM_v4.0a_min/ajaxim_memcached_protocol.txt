Node Server Memcached Protocol
for logging users in and out of the server.
-------------------------------------------

add <username> <!ignore flags> <!ignore exptime> <bytes> [!ignore noreply]\r\n

- <username> is the username of the new user

- <flags> and <exptime> are ignored.

- <bytes> is the number of bytes in the data block to follow, *not*
  including the delimiting \r\n. <bytes> may *not* be zero.
  
After this line, the client sends the JSON-encoded data block:

<data block>\r\n

- <data block> is JSON-encoded information about the user, having a length
  of <bytes> bytes.

After sending the command line and the data block, the client awaits
the reply, which may be:

- "STORED\r\n", to indicate that the user is or has been logged in.

- "NOT_STORED\r\n", to indicate that there was a problem storing the
  new user data.

Retrieval command:
------------------

The retrieval commands "get" and "gets" operates like this:

get <type/identifier>\r\n
gets <type/identifier> <type/identifier> <...>\r\n

- <type/identifier> is one of:
  - session/<session_id> where <session_id> is the session of an
    existing user.
    > returns information about the user
  - username/<username> where <username> is the (properly formatted)
    username of a logged in user.
    > returns information about the user
  - list/
    > returns a list of all online users
  - online/
    > returns an integer value of the online user count

After this command, the client expects zero or more items, each of
which is received as a text line followed by a data block. After all
the items have been transmitted, the server sends the string

"END\r\n"

to indicate the end of response.

Each item sent by the server looks like this:

VALUE <key> <flags> <bytes>\r\n
<data block>\r\n

- <key> is the key for the item being sent

- <flags> is set to 0

- <bytes> is the length of the data block to follow, *not* including
  its delimiting \r\n

- <data block> is the data for this response, usually in JSON format (exception: online/).

If some of the keys appearing in a retrieval request are not sent back
by the server in the item list this means that the server does not
hold items with such keys (because they were never stored, or stored
but deleted to make space for more items, or expired, or explicitly
deleted by a client).

Logging out
--------

The command "delete" allows for explicit logging out of users:

delete <username>\r\n

- <username> is the username of the user the client wishes the server
  to log out.

The response line to this command can be one of:

- "DELETED\r\n" to indicate success

- "NOT_FOUND\r\n" to indicate that the user with this username was not
  found.
